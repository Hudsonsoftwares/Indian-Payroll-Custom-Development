Custom Kitchen Display System for Odoo Community Edition
==========================================================
Recreates the core workflow of the Enterprise "Preparation Display" app
so restaurants on Community Edition can run a kitchen screen without an
Enterprise subscription.

Features
--------
* Configurable displays: pick which Point of Sale(s) and product
  categories feed each screen (e.g. Grill screen, Bar screen).
* Configurable stages per display (To cook / Ready / Completed, or your
  own names), each with an optional "late" alert timer.
* Touch-friendly, responsive kitchen screen (phone/tablet/TV) with All /
  stage tabs, time filters (Now / Today / Tomorrow / Next days) and
  fulfillment filters (Dine In / Takeout / Delivery), zoom controls,
  Recall, Undo (previous stage), dark & high-contrast modes, and audio
  alerts for new/late orders.
* Near real-time updates via bus.bus push, with polling as a safety net.
* Public customer-facing order-status page (big "Ready" / "Almost
  there" style screen) driven by a per-order access token.
* Orders are sent to the kitchen automatically when a POS order is
  created; a manual "resend" action covers items added later (e.g.
  kiosk/self-order flows).
* Kitchen Order History report (list/pivot/graph) with per-order prep
  duration for manager auditing and average-time analysis.
* "Kitchen Screen Access" user flag for kitchen-only logins that aren't
  full POS users.

See README.md in this folder for setup notes and known limitations.
